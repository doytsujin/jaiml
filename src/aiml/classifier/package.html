<p>Contains all functionality and classes to perform AIML pattern mathing. For
the end user, these particular classes may be considered the API to use the
aiml package:
<dl>
<dt>aiml.AIMLMatcher</dt>
<dd>The matching functionality</dd>
<dt>aiml.Path</dt>
<dd>Represents the path, or "category context". Create objects of this class to
set the conditions for a particular match.</dd>
<dt>aiml.context.ContextInfo</dt>
<dd>Maintans information about all known contexts. Encapsulates the "state
of the world". You must initialize this structure with enough context sources
before adding paths to the PatternMatcher!
</dd>
<dt>aiml.context.Context</dt>
<dd>Encapsulates a particular state used in matching. Inherit this to provide
sources of data for your matching environment.
</dd>

<p>Please be aware that the organization of this library is not yet final, and
that in future releases, the package structure and implementation details may
change. The basic layout and usage should not.</p>
